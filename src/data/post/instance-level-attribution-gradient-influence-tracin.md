This note is part of my series **Training Data Attribution for NLP and LLM Research**. The series is written as both a research notebook and an interview preparation path: each article should help me explain the idea clearly, connect it to my thesis, and identify what would become future PhD work.

**Guiding question:** Which training examples are most related to one prediction or evaluation behaviour?

## Intuition

Gradient similarity asks whether two examples would push parameters in similar directions. Influence functions approximate what would happen if a training example were upweighted. TracIn accumulates gradient alignment over checkpoints, avoiding one heavy inverse-Hessian computation but depending on saved training states.

In NLP and LLM research, this matters because model behaviour is deeply shaped by data mixture. A model may be fluent because of broad web text, domain-accurate because of specialised documents, safer because of curated instruction data, or biased because of repeated patterns in a subset of the corpus. Training-data attribution gives us language for asking these questions systematically instead of only saying "the data matters".

## Formal lens

Gradient similarity often uses cos(grad_theta L(z_train), grad_theta L(z_test)). Influence functions approximate the effect of upweighting z_train on test loss using -grad L_test^T H^{-1} grad L_train. TracIn sums gradient inner products across checkpoints, usually weighted by learning rate.

The important discipline is to define the attribution setup before interpreting the score:

| Design choice    | Question to answer                                                                      |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Attribution unit | What receives credit: source, group, document, example, or token?                       |
| Utility function | Which behaviour is being explained: quality, terminology, style, factuality, or safety? |
| Intervention     | Are we adding, deleting, reweighting, correcting, or retraining?                        |
| Estimator        | Is the score exact, sampled, gradient-based, surrogate-based, or heuristic?             |
| Uncertainty      | How stable is the score across seeds, samples, metrics, and evaluation sets?            |

## NLP / LLM example

For an MT error involving a petroleum term, gradient-based retrieval may surface training sentence pairs with similar terminology or syntactic patterns. This is helpful for error analysis, but it still needs validation: retrieved examples may be correlated with the error without being the cause of it.

This is why I do not want to treat attribution as a generic interpretability topic. For my profile, the natural connection is multilingual and domain-specific NLP: low-resource settings, technical terminology, written-standard variation, and evaluation beyond one headline metric.

## Connection to my thesis

In my thesis narrative, training-data attribution is useful because it turns a vague data question into an experimental design:

1. define interpretable data units;
2. define the model behaviour to explain;
3. compare controlled data coalitions or interventions;
4. estimate contribution;
5. report uncertainty and limitations;
6. decide what evidence is strong enough to support a causal-style claim.

That structure helps me avoid overclaiming. A score is not automatically a causal explanation. It is a measurement produced by a specific setup.

## What I have done, understand, and would extend

| Level                                        | Status                                                                                                                                              |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Already completed / thesis-ready             | Group-level attribution, coalition thinking, metric-based utilities, cautious interpretation, random baselines, bootstrap-style reliability checks. |
| I understand but may not fully implement yet | Instance-level gradient attribution, influence functions, TracIn, Monte Carlo Shapley, surrogate/datamodel approximations.                          |
| Strong PhD extension                         | Hierarchical attribution, intervention-based validation, factuality/style-specific utilities, scalable attribution for LLM data mixtures.           |

## Interview answer

I would distinguish these methods clearly. Gradient similarity is simpler and cheaper, influence functions are more causal in spirit but depend on strong approximations, and TracIn is a checkpoint-based practical alternative. For my current work, instance-level methods are a diagnostic extension beyond group-level attribution.
